        "About Me": "My training as an MD and PhD provides the ideal framework for my work as a clinician-scientist in the field of lung  inflammation and repair. My current research focuses on the role of stretch-activated ion channels in the development  of ventilator-induced lung injury, inflammatory mediator secretion, loss of epithelial barrier function and lung repair  mechanisms. Importantly, we detected for the first time the expression of stretch-activated, 2-pore domain potassium  (K2P) channels in the lung1 and discovered that the K2P channel TREK-1 plays a crucial role in the development of  hyperoxia- and mechanical stretch-induced lung injury using both in vitro and in vivo models of lung injury2,3. For this  purpose, we created several stable, TREK-1 deficient and TREK-1 overexpressing murine and human lung epithelial  cells lines. By employing molecular, genetic, electrophysiology and state-of-the-art imaging techniques, including  confocal microscopy, electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), as well as several K2P deficient  mouse models, my lab has received international recognition for elucidating the role of K2P channels in hyperoxiaand  mechanical stretch-induced lung epithelial injury4. Over the years. my research has been supported by  institutional, national and international funding agencies, including the University of Tennessee Children\u2019s  Foundation Research Institute, the NIH and the American Lung Association, the Hans and Blanca Moser Foundation  and the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research. In addition, I am an ad-hoc reviewer for 9 scientific  journals. Furthermore, I am currently a co-investigator for the first randomized, controlled trial studying the effects of  prolonged steroid treatment on children with ARDS.",
